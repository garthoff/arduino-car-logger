Arduino Car Logger

Arduino Car logger is a sofware build for the 
Arduino Mega board to log different data from automotive
environment. 

The idea is to read bunch of AD 10-bit voltage values and
bunch of frequency values from multitude of sensors and then
convert that to a human understandable format (eg, real values)
which will then be printed out via the serial interfaces and
displayed on the lcd display.
